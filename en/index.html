<h2 id="post-mortem-the-2020-parliamentary-elections-polls-and-exit-polls">Post Mortem: The 2020 Parliamentary Elections, Polls, and Exit Polls</h2>
<p>In the 2020 parliamentary elections, we again faced so-called &ldquo;polling wars,&rdquo; yet, opinion research landscape was reasonably diverse. Thirty polls were conducted in the year leading to the 2020 parliamentary elections, with results available to the public. On election day, four different organizations conducted exit polls. How accurate or inaccurate are the pre-election polls and poll-based predictions? In this post, we will review how pre-election polls and exit polls predicted winners.</p>
<p>The pandemic affected how polling is done in Georgia. For example, surveys conducted by the National Democratic Institute and CRRC-Georgia in 2020 were usually administered over the phone. Such an approach was also used by other pollsters too. Still, other pollsters preferred to administer surveys in person.</p>
<p>To assess the quality of the election forecast, we compared the results of publicly available polls with election outcomes. To assess the degree of difference of each research initiative, we calculated a simple indicator - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). RMSE is a root of differences between the squares of the predicted proportions for each party in a poll and the election result. For comparison, we took polls that were conducted closest to the election day. As a result, the RMSE indicator allows us to rank polling initiatives by their proximity to elections.</p>
<p>How accurate were exit polls? The table below provides two sets of indicators. The first value of the RMSE is calculated for all parties. The other assesses the accuracy of how a polling initiative predicted vote share only for the Georgian Dream and the United National Movement parties.</p>
<iframe src="/maps/exitpolls/exitpolls2020/en/" width="800" height="270" scrolling="auto" frameborder="0" margin="0" padding="0"></iframe>
<p>Edison Research&rsquo;s exit poll leads the prediction quality league table. The organization had the smallest error both when predicting results for all parties and the most significant two parties. The exit poll conducted by Ipsos for the Mtavari TV channel turned out to be the most inaccurate. Survation&rsquo;s forecast was relatively close, while the survey for Imedi was also fairly off from election results. Needless to say, that exit polls conducted by media outlets with strong political sympathies were particularly inaccurate in their forecasted vote share for major parties.</p>
<p>As for the pre-election polls, Edison Research also stood out in its quality. Their opinion polls closely coincided with the election results, despite the fact that the organization&rsquo;s nearest survey to the voting date was completed on September 7th, that is, almost three weeks prior to the election day. The IRI survey that was conducted in mid-August was also reasonably close to election results (as a caveat, we used proportions for decided votes, thus excluding those who answered Don&rsquo;t know or refused to answer). Next was our own re-calculation based on  CRRC-Georgia&rsquo;s omnibus survey. Here we used the non-response weighting method to re-allocate undecided votes or refusals.</p>
<iframe src="/maps/exitpolls/polls2020/en/" width="800" height="650" overflow="noscroll" frameborder="0" margin="0" padding="0"></iframe>
<p>Notably, fieldworks for Survation, Gorbi, and Ipsos opinion polls were closest to the election day. Nonetheless, their estimates were considerably off from election results than that of Edison Research, IRI, or Omnibus.</p>
<p>In short, the accuracy of estimates of political affiliation varies across polling initiatives. Thus, when forecasting election outcomes, it is essential to account for pollster accuracy. In our future posts, we will discuss in detail how we resolved this problem when working on the updated Pollster.ge forecasts.</p>

</header>
<div class="content">
Prior to the 2021 Municipal Elections of Georgia, Pollster.ge will again offer forecasts based on the publicly available polling data. Thus far, we have tried to predict the outcomes of the 2018 Presidential and 2020 Parliamentary elections. Some of our expectations proved to be accurate, with significant discrepancies. Before we present our forecast for the 2021 elections, we would like to briefly summarize the work we have done.
We have applied two different approaches to aggregate polling results, the weighted/running average method and &ldquo;state space&rdquo; statistical model.

Two days before the 2020 Parliamentary Elections of Georgia, Pollster.ge publishes its fifth and final forecasts. Overall, the ruling Georgian Dream party will face challenges in forming the majority in the parliament, while elections most probably will be decided in single-member districts.
 Our previous forecast showed that ratings for the ruling party were diminishing. The trend was also maintained in the most recent polls too. The weighted averages model indicates that the ruling party&rsquo;s support shrunk from [47% to 42%](

The 2020 Parliamentary polls are at the door, and political campaigns are accelerating. So are our forecasts. Our last series of predictions reflected how Georgians felt about political parties in late August. According to them, the Georgian Dream had impressive chances of winning elections and obtaining a comfortable majority in the parliament. Nonetheless, we also warned that the deteriorating epidemiological situation with COVID-19 would force Georgian Dream&rsquo;s poll numbers to go south.

Recently, several opinion polls were published in Georgia. Data came from international organizations the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institution as well as news media outlets Imedi, Rustavi 2, and Formula. This gave us enough materials to update our forecasts.
All surveys that are used in this forecast, were administered prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 in Georgia in early September. We do not have clear understanding how poll numbers were affected, although how volatile Georgian public opinion can get, we do expect some changes.

<div class="content">
For electoral forecasting, we are currently using thirty-six pre-electoral and political survey results that were conducted after the 2016 parliamentarian elections. Besides, data analysis also includes numbers from the 2016 Parliamentarian and 2017 local government elections. As for the October 2020 wave of CRRC-Georgia&rsquo;s omnibus survey, we did our version of nonresponse weighting. The corresponding STATA file is available here
The range of public opinion surveys is diverse in terms of fieldwork and data collections methodologies, as well as pollsters’ and commissioners’ political and institutional affiliations.

Weighted average Our approach is based on two basic methods. The first one, so-called weighted average assumes the averaging of openly available survey results. As you may notice, the data is not comprehensive due to the imperfections of the sources used in our calculations. With rare exceptions, the authors of the surveys seldom publish the methodology, the wording of the questions, and the raw data. The method of forecasting using the weighted average is pretty simple: only the answers indicating the support for a particular political party are taken into account.
