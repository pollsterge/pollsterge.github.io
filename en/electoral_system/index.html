<p>2020 Georgian Parliamentarian polls will be held using a mixed, proportional-majoritarian system. Following the 2019 June events ruling “Georgian Dream” party proposed the transition to the fully proportional representation electoral system. However, during the 2019 autumn parliamentarian hearings, the constitutional amendments necessary for implementation that idea were rejected. This triggered a political crisis in the country. Through international support and mediation, key political parties reached a compromise during spring 2020. As a result, 120 seats out of 150 possible will be allocated using the proportional representation, while rest 30 mandates will be elected through 30 single-member constituencies.
The decrease in the number of majoritarian MPs altered the traditionally existing majoritarian electoral district. Tbilisi, the capital city, was divided into eight majoritarian districts. Two other largest urban areas of Georgia – Kutaisi, and Batumi – became standalone majoritarian districts. Rest 20 majoritarian seats were allocated to the amalgamated unites. The legal boundaries of the new majoritarian districts are defined at the  <a href="https://cesko.ge/geo/static/3266/-saqartvelos-parlamentis-2020-tslis-archevnebisatvis-majoritarul-saarchevno-olqebshi-shemavali-saarchevno-ubnebis-sazghvrebi">website</a>. of the Georgian Central Electoral Commission. The geographic redistribution of the new majoritarian districts is the following:</p>

<p>According to the Georgian Electoral Code, the parliament seats through the proportional part of the elections will be allocated to the political parties that will gain at least 1 percent of valid votes, and in case of the political block, that will receive valid votes bigger than 1 percent multiplied by the number of political parties united in that electoral block.
For the redistribution of the parliamentarian seats, the number of actual votes received in the elections is multiplied by 120 and divided by the sum of the number of actual votes received by all those political parties and electoral blocs that passed the relevant electoral threshold. In the case of undistributed seats, mandates will be distributed in sequence to the most significant political parties and electoral blocs.
Another significant change in the new electoral code is associated with the principle of proportional representation. The number of parliamentarian mandates should not exceed the number of actual votes received by a political force in a proportional election. Besides, the political subject should gain more than 40% of votes thought proportional elections to form the government independently. If no party solely received more than 40% of votes the coalition government should be formed</p>
