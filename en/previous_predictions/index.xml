      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;predicted-party-vote-share-for-august-17th-2020&#34;&gt;Predicted party vote share for August 17th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forecast is based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/methods/&#34;&gt;weighted average method&lt;/a&gt;. Data come from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/polls/&#34;&gt;28 publicly available&lt;/a&gt; poll results. Proportions are calculated for  decided voters only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/02_august_17/weighted_average_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;poll-numbers-for-four-major-political-parties-for-august-17th-2020&#34;&gt;Poll numbers for four major political parties for August 17th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below displays poll numbers for four major parties since the late 2016 unti July 24th. Only proportions for decided voters are displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/02_august_17/dynamics_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-space-model-of-election-forecast-for-august-17th-2020&#34;&gt;State-space model of election forecast for August 17th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows results of 2,000 simulations based on publicly available poll numbers. Overall, median value of simulated vote share for GD is 56%, 20% for the UNM, 8% for European Georgia, and 5% for the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia. Considering low electoral threshold, all of the parties listed above have a decent chance of passing through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis of simulations show that in the current situation, Georgian Dream has about 52% chance of winning the majority in proportional voting. The ruling party also has a very high chance (95%) of passing through the 40% closing threshold that will allow GD to single-handedly form the government. Current predictions show that the chance of obtaining constitutional majority for the Georgian Dream party only via proportional voting is marginal (&amp;lt;1%). Seemingly, the party will need to concentrate on majoritarian seats to guarantee full control of Georgia&amp;rsquo;s legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances that the Georgian Dream might lose to its main rival, the United National Movement? Predictions haven&amp;rsquo;t changed significantly from the last wave. There&amp;rsquo;s less than 0.2% chance of the United National Movement receiving more votes in proportional voting than the Georgian Dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, important caveats exist: while distribution of predictions for other parties are quite steep, that is, concentrated around the median value, that for the Georgian Dream is relatively flat. This indicates to the fact that support for the ruling party is a bit more volatile and prone to fluctuations. While the pandemic response has definitely increased support for the Georgian Dream, a million dollar question would be whether the party will be able to hold up to election day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;forecast-for-october-14th-2020&#34;&gt;Forecast for October 14th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2020 Parliamentary polls are at the door, and political campaigns are accelerating. So are our forecasts. Our last series of predictions reflected how Georgians felt about political parties in late August. According to them, the Georgian Dream had impressive chances of winning elections and obtaining a comfortable majority in the parliament.  Nonetheless, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/previous_predictions/september_18th/&#34;&gt;we also warned&lt;/a&gt; that the deteriorating epidemiological situation with COVID-19 would force Georgian Dream&amp;rsquo;s poll numbers to go south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/04_october_14/weighted_average_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts were correct: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/previous_predictions/september_18th/&#34;&gt;in our fresh simple model&lt;/a&gt; that includes opinion polls from September and October, the Georgian Dream&amp;rsquo;s poll numbers are below 50%. While the ruling party still leads the race with 47%, it is 6-point less than the situation one month ago. The same model shows that the United National Movement still maintains its title of the strongest oppositional party. Their poll numbers increased by three percentage points compared to our late August/early September model. Other oppositional parties also improved their poll numbers, except for the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/04_october_14/dynamics_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did political ratings change over time? Our retrospective analysis of aggregated poll data hints that after the 2016 parliamentary elections, the Georgian Dream managed to maintain decent ratings and, on average, polled above 50%. Although their support gradually dwindled and reached its minimum in summer 2019. After the infamous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48710042&#34;&gt;Gavrilov&amp;rsquo;s Night&lt;/a&gt;, the government and other oppositional parties&amp;rsquo; gap closed to its historical minimum. The situation altered since Spring 2020 when Georgian Dream&amp;rsquo;s poll numbers grew again and reached the 2016 levels. As we have argued previously, improved ratings were primarily driven &lt;a href=&#34;http://crrc-caucasus.blogspot.com/2020/07/covid-19-monitor-new-report-on-georgian.html&#34;&gt;by the positive public perception&lt;/a&gt; of how state institutions managed the first COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020. As the number of COVID-19 cases started growing exponentially since early September, support for the Georgian Dream diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/04_october_14/model_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to our Bayesian model, chances the Georgian Dream has a relatively slim (27%) chance of receiving more than half of the proportional elections votes. Our simulations show that the most expected outcome of proportional polls would be that the Georgian Dream polls around 47%. As this would garner only fifty-six seats in the parliament, races in single-member (majoritarian) districts will be decisive. As the Georgian Dream is almost guaranteed to overcome the 40% &amp;ldquo;closing&amp;rdquo; threshold, they would aim to win at least twenty majoritarian seats to have a simple majority (76 MPs) in the parliament. Considering the current situation, this seems rather achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the other parties poll enough to defeat the Georgian Dream single-handedly. Simulations show that it is almost impossible for them to overcome the closing 40% threshold too. Considering the low electoral threshold, all parties presented in the table below have decent chances of being represented in the new parliament. Despite this, only European Georgian and Strategy Aghmashenebeli seem to poll high enough for garnering six parliamentary seats necessary for an independent parliamentary faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/chances/en/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;650&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands and given that no dramatic changes occur until the election day, the Georgian Dream is expected to win the plurality of votes. Though the main intrigue will rest on single-member district races. Unfortunately, as poll data on majoritarian races are very scant, we cannot provide predictions. Another issue to watch is which party Georgian Dream decides to partner with if it fails to win enough majoritarian seats necessary for a simple majority.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;forecast-for-october-28th-2020&#34;&gt;Forecast for October 28th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days before the 2020 Parliamentary Elections of Georgia, Pollster.ge publishes its fifth and final forecasts. Overall, the ruling Georgian Dream party will face challenges in forming the majority in the parliament, while elections most probably will be decided in single-member districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/05_october_28/weighted_average_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous forecast showed that ratings for the ruling party were diminishing. The trend was also maintained in the most recent polls too. The weighted averages model indicates that the ruling party&amp;rsquo;s support shrunk from [47% to 42%](&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/previous_predictions/october_14th/&#34;&gt;October 14th&lt;/a&gt;, as ratings have improved for the opposition. Nonetheless, only the United National Movement polls in two-digit numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/05_october_28/dynamics_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemingly, time works against the Georgian Dream. We have explained why the aggravated epidemiological conditions might have deteriorated their poll numbers. In parallel with the growing number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, support for the Georgian Dream diminished. Presumably, the hostage crisis in &lt;a href=&#34;https://1tv.ge/news/zugdidshi-saqartvelos-bankshi-sheiaraghebulma-pirma-mdzevlebi-aiyvana/&#34;&gt;Zugdidi&lt;/a&gt; contributed to the declining support for the ruling party. While numbers are shrinking, changes are not that dramatic to prevent the Georgian Dream from winning proportional polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/05_october_28/model_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Bayesian model indicates the same. Instead of forecasting the latest public opinion poll numbers, we estimated weighted averages of all polls in our updated model. Nonetheless, the dynamics are somewhat expected: as the Georgian Dream has almost no chance of passing through the 50% barrier, the party is highly likely to win enough votes for passing through the closing 40.5% threshold. We project that the party has about an 80% chance of doing so. Other political groups have no chance to win over the Georgian Dream or squeak through the closing threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/chances/en/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;650&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question is, how will smaller political parties do in proportional voting. This might be important if there is a necessity to form a governing coalition. Those parties which are already in the parliament are projected to win seats again. Besides, &amp;ldquo;Strategy Aghmashenebeli,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Lelo,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Girchi,&amp;rdquo; and the Labor Party are highly likely to end up in the parliament. Nonetheless, only &amp;ldquo;Strategy Aghmashenebeli&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;European Georgia&amp;rdquo; have reasonable chances of having enough seats for having a separate faction, as does &amp;ldquo;Lelo.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our projections are correct, it is highly likely that voting in majoritarian elections will decide who will form the government. As it stands now, the Georgian Dream needs at least 27 majoritarian seats to form a simple majority. Unfortunately, we are unable to forecast majoritarian races. Therefore, our understanding is based on the experience of previous elections. As the latter shows us, ruling parties almost always have an incumbent advantage in majoritarian races.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;forecasts-for-september-18th-2020&#34;&gt;Forecasts for September 18th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, several opinion polls were published in Georgia. Data came from international organizations the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institution as well as news media outlets Imedi, Rustavi 2, and Formula. This gave us enough materials to update our forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All surveys that are used in this forecast, were administered prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 in Georgia in early September. We do not have clear understanding how poll numbers were affected, although how volatile Georgian public opinion can get, we do expect some changes. In sum, the analysis below should be interpreted as something that reflects the situation ante, that is, a “pre-outbreak normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/methods/&#34;&gt;in the methodology section&lt;/a&gt;, we only use proportions that reflect decided voters, that is, those who have disclosed their preferences. On the one hand, this is due to the fact that some pollsters (for instance, Survation/Rustavi 2) only publish results that show proportions among decided voters. Next, on what we saw in previous forecasts, proportions that are calculated without undecided respondents are to a large extent accurate reflection of what the public’s voting intentions are. Indeed, we acknowledge that this approach has its perils, for instance, not accounting for “shy opposition” voters, or the uncertainty associated with relatively smaller sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/03_september_18/weighted_average_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Georgian Dream seems to have been leading a league table in our “simplistic” weighted averages model and Bayesian forecasts. Weighted averages predict the ruling party being supported by 53% of those who have declared party preferences; Bayesian model speaks about 49% support. The discrepancies between these models can be explained by the sensitivity of the latter to outliers in raw poll numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weighted averages model predicts that nine oppositional parties have chances of getting into the parliament, although all of them except the United National Movement (18%), poll between 1% to 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While polls seem to have not shifted drastically, our Bayesian model suggests relative decrease in chances of the Georgian Dream garnering 50% of voters. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/ka/previous_predictions/august_17th/&#34;&gt;While our previous forecast&lt;/a&gt; showed that the governing party had about 56% of doing so, now chances are about 48%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/03_september_18/model_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds of overcoming a 40% “closing” threshold remain stable and high. The Georgian Dream has about 94% chance of obtaining enough votes for single-handedly forming the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are almost negligible chances of the Georgian Dream either getting enough votes through proportional elections to have constitutional majority, or the United National Movement overtaking the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/03_september_18/dynamics_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to our previous predictions, our models hint on the volatility of support for the Georgian Dream. At a first glance, a Covid-induced boost for the ruling party seems to be plateaued and the Georgian Dream was almost guaranteed an easy ride if elections were held in late August. Nonetheless, it is too early to call the winner, as polls open in almost eight weeks from now. As we have no information how polls shifted due to the second outbreak, and there is still enough time for the opposition (and the government) to campaign, one can argue that the fate of elections will be sealed in the last weeks of October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-space-model-of-election-forecast-for-july-13th-2020&#34;&gt;State-space model of election forecast for July 13th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows results of 2,000 simulations based on publicly available poll numbers. Overall, median value of simulated vote share for GD is 50%, 20% for the UNM, 6% for European Georgia, and 4% for the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia. Considering low electoral threshold, all of the parties listed above have a decent chance of passing through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis of simulations show that in the current situation, Georgian Dream has about 50% chance of winning the majority in proportional voting. The ruling party also has a very high chance (93%) of passing through the 40% closing threshold that will allow GD to single-handedly form the government. Current predictions show that the chance of obtaining constitutional majority for the Georgian Dream party only via proportional voting is marginal (&amp;lt;1%). Seemingly, the party will need to concentrate on majoritarian seats to guarantee full control of Georgia&amp;rsquo;s legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances that the Georgian Dream might lose to its main rival, the United National Movement? Thus far, chances are negligible: there&amp;rsquo;s less than 1% chance of the United National Movement receiving more votes in proportional voting than the Georgian Dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, important caveats exist: while distribution of predictions for other parties are quite steep, that is, concentrated around the median value, that for the Georgian Dream is relatively flat. This indicates to the fact that support for the ruling party is a bit more volatile and prone to fluctuations. While the pandemic response has definitely increased support for the Georgian Dream, a million dollar question would be whether the party will be able to hold up to election day.&lt;/p&gt;
