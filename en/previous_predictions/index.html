Forecast for October 14th, 2020 The 2020 Parliamentary polls are at the door, and political campaigns are accelerating. So are our forecasts. Our last series of predictions reflected how Georgians felt about political parties in late August. According to them, the Georgian Dream had impressive chances of winning elections and obtaining a comfortable majority in the parliament. Nonetheless, we also warned that the deteriorating epidemiological situation with COVID-19 would force Georgian Dream&rsquo;s poll numbers to go south.

Forecast for October 28th, 2020 Two days before the 2020 Parliamentary Elections of Georgia, Pollster.ge publishes its fifth and final forecasts. Overall, the ruling Georgian Dream party will face challenges in forming the majority in the parliament, while elections most probably will be decided in single-member districts.
 Our previous forecast showed that ratings for the ruling party were diminishing. The trend was also maintained in the most recent polls too.

Forecasts for September 18th, 2020 Recently, several opinion polls were published in Georgia. Data came from international organizations the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institution as well as news media outlets Imedi, Rustavi 2, and Formula. This gave us enough materials to update our forecasts.
All surveys that are used in this forecast, were administered prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 in Georgia in early September. We do not have clear understanding how poll numbers were affected, although how volatile Georgian public opinion can get, we do expect some changes.
